# Nyaya: Web3 Integrated FIR Filing system

## Introduction

Nyaya is a revolutionary project designed to revolutionize the process of filing and verifying FIRs (First Information Reports) by leveraging blockchain technology. In a world where personal safety can be compromised when seeking justice, Nyaya provides a secure and anonymous platform for individuals to report crimes, ensuring their identities remain protected while promoting transparency and accountability in the legal system.

## Overview

Nyaya introduces a decentralized system that enables users to file FIRs anonymously, ensuring their safety and privacy through World ID's proof of personhood protocol. The platform securely records complaints on the blockchain, where they undergo verification by authorized police officers. By safeguarding user identities and utilizing blockchain's immutable ledger, Nyaya fosters a more transparent, secure, and trustworthy environment for filing FIRs, empowering individuals to seek justice without fear of retaliation.

## Key Features

- **Anonymity and Privacy:** Nyaya allows users to file FIRs without revealing their identities, safeguarding them from potential retaliation. World ID's proof of personhood protocol ensures privacy while maintaining the system's integrity.
- **Blockchain Security:**  FIRs are recorded on the blockchain, creating an immutable and transparent ledger. This guarantees that once an FIR is filed, it cannot be altered, preserving the accuracy and reliability of the report.
- **Secure Verification Process:** Authorized police officers can verify and validate FIRs through a secure and transparent process, ensuring that only legitimate cases are registered.
- **Smart Contracts on Celo:** The platform's smart contracts are deployed using Blockscout on the Celo network, specifically on the Dango and Alfajers testnets, ensuring secure and efficient contract execution.

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a Hardhat Ignition module that deploys that contract.

## How to run the Project

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/Lock.js
```
